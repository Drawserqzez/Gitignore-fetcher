# Introduction

This is a small script that I made to fetch gitignore template files from the official github repository based on project/lanaguage name.
Ex ` gitignore.py python ` would fetch the gitignore template file for python =)

While far from perfect it works well enough for me =) Might work more on it if I find something more I want it to do
